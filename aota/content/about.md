Why this topic? Why this park? What is going on here? 

When we peer into our phones we are sucked away from 
our moments. We sit scrolling, disconnected, disaffected and stripped
from our context. 

The primary cause, of course, technology, but could technology not
bring about a sense of history, place, and common destiny? 

I think so. I hope so. It's why I started  this project. 

Art Over the Airwaves is meant to be a site specific installation
of any particular digital material. It doesn't have to be historical.
It could be an art gallery or a blog, if you wanted. What makes
it special though is that this digital content can only be accessed
from within the immediate area. You will not find this website indexed 
on Google. You can't link to it from Wikipedia. 

This conjuration created purely by someone who lives in this 
community for the community. 

If you're interested in using this for your own purposes, you can 
find the instructions on setting it up here. <insert github link>
