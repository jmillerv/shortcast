This park and neighborhood sit on lands that originally belonged to the [Arapaho](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/arapaho/), [Cheyenne](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/Cheyenne/), Očeti Šakówiŋ (roughly pronounced as oh-chey-tee shah-koh-ween) [[1]](https://www.dictionary.com/e/sioux-article/) ([Sioux](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/oceti-sakowin-sioux/)), and
Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ ([Ute](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/ute/)) tribes.

Before being called Cesar Chavez Park it was called Alcott Park after the Alcott School which sat empty for 84 years before
being destroyed in a fire in the 70s. 

The park was renamed in 2005 after grassroots organizers built support for the renaming by collecting over 300 signatures in a
two year period [[2]](https://www.denverpost.com/2005/07/25/park-to-be-renamed-for-cesar-chavez/).
