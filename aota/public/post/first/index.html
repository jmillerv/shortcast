<h1>History of Cesar Chavez Park</h1>
<h2>Sun, Feb 22, 6028</h2>
<p>This place you&rsquo;re sitting. Have you ever thought
about it. Do you give much consideration to
the places you visit? Have you ever noticed
the Si Se Puede! Embossed on the concrete?
What about the bust of a man that sometimes a
little girl sells lemonade under while a man
strolls by walking his cat?</p>
<p>What is this place? What was this place?
Well, you&rsquo;re likely a parent keeping an eye on
your children as they play on the Jungle Gym, so
let&rsquo;s start with this park.</p>
<p>This park wasn&rsquo;t always Cesar Chavez park.
It was initially something else, but like the demographics
of this neighborhood things change.</p>
